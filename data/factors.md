To determine if a planet is potentially habitable, several key factors from the provided dataset are particularly important. Here are the most relevant columns:

1. **pl_orbsmax**: **Orbit Semi-Major Axis [au]**
   - This indicates the distance of the planet from its star, which is crucial for assessing whether it lies within the "habitable zone," where conditions might be right for liquid water to exist.

2. **pl_insol**: **Insolation Flux [Earth Flux]**
   - This measures the amount of stellar energy received by the planet, which directly affects its temperature and potential for supporting life.

3. **pl_eqt**: **Equilibrium Temperature [K]**
   - This represents the temperature the planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, influencing its climate and habitability.

4. **pl_rade**: **Planet Radius [Earth Radius]**
   - The size of the planet can indicate its composition (rocky vs. gaseous) and whether it has sufficient gravity to hold an atmosphere.

5. **pl_bmasse**: **Planet Mass or Mass*sin(i) [Earth Mass]**
   - Mass affects the planet's gravity and can give insights into its ability to retain an atmosphere, which is critical for habitability.

6. **pl_orbeccen**: **Eccentricity**
   - This describes the shape of the planet's orbit. A high eccentricity can lead to significant variations in temperature, which might impact habitability.

7. **st_spectype**: **Spectral Type**
   - The type of star affects the radiation and temperature conditions around the planet, influencing its habitability.

8. **st_teff**: **Stellar Effective Temperature [K]**
   - This indicates the temperature of the star, which can affect the habitable zone and the planet's climate.

These factors combined can help astronomers and scientists assess the likelihood of a planet being able to support life as we know it.
