Here are the values for Earth regarding the specified factors that determine its habitability:

1. **pl_orbsmax (Orbit Semi-Major Axis)**:
   - **Value**: Approximately **1 AU (Astronomical Unit)**, which is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun (about **149.6 million kilometers**).

2. **pl_insol (Insolation Flux)**:
   - **Value**: Approximately **1 Earth Flux** (or **1361 W/m²**), which is the amount of solar energy received per square meter at the top of Earth's atmosphere.

3. **pl_eqt (Equilibrium Temperature)**:
   - **Value**: Approximately **255 K** (about **-18 °C**). This is the average temperature of Earth if it had no atmosphere and received the same amount of solar energy.

4. **pl_rade (Planet Radius)**:
   - **Value**: **1 Earth Radius**, which is approximately **6371 kilometers**.

5. **pl_bmasse (Planet Mass)**:
   - **Value**: Approximately **1 Earth Mass**, which is about **5.97 × 10²⁴ kg**.

6. **pl_orbeccen (Eccentricity)**:
   - **Value**: Approximately **0.0167**, indicating that Earth's orbit is nearly circular with slight eccentricity.

7. **st_spectype (Spectral Type)**:
   - **Value**: **G2V**, indicating that the Sun is a G-type main-sequence star, or yellow dwarf.

8. **st_teff (Stellar Effective Temperature)**:
   - **Value**: Approximately **5778 K**, which is the effective surface temperature of the Sun.

| pl_rade                        | 1 Earth Radius (6371 km)          |
| pl_bmasse                      | 1 Earth Mass (5.97 × 10²⁴ kg)     |
| pl_orbeccen                    | 0.0167                             |
| st_spectype                    | G2V                                |
| st_teff                        | 5778 K                             |

You can use these values to compare with those of other exoplanets to assess their potential habitability.
